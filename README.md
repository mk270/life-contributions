Life Contributions
==================

This is a Chrome browser extension which turns Github Contributions calendars
into initial positions in Conway's Game of Life

The author is not John Conway, but did attend a 60th birthday party in Conway's
honour, but was not introduced to him after threatening to say "Ah, you're 
the guy who invented that screensaver!"

[Video demo](http://mk.ucant.org/media/life-contributions.flv) - advice on Linux screen capture technology gratefully received

Installation
------------

I've not provided a .crx file, as I have no idea whether this introduced
security holes. You can install the files manually by cloning the repo
then following [these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html#unpacked)
